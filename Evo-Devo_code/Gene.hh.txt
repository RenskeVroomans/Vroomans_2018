====== Gene.hh ======
Created Wednesday 02 October 2013

includes ChromBB.hh

creates a Class Gene which inherits from the class ChromBB

public:
 int gact_;
  int ginh_;

Gene();//constructor
virtual ChromBB* clone() const;
~Gene();//destructor
Gene(int t,int a, int i);//constructor with arguments
explicit Gene(const Gene &gene);//copy constructor	

**The code contains the following comments:**

to be able to switch the type of function used for activation and inhibition by TF bound to upstream TFBS:
  //0=max functie
  //1=prod functie

activation:
max functie: (OR)
1 and 0 -> 1
0 and 1 -> 1
1 and 1 -> 1
0 and 0 -> 1
so if multiple activators can bind to UR only one needs to be on to switch the gene on
if only one activator can bind to UR, it being on suffices to switch the gene on
however if zero activators can bind to UR, make sure that gene is off --> HUH? hier staat ook aan....zal wel foutje zijn

activation:
prod functie: (AND)
 1 and 0 -> 0
 0 and 1 -> 0
 1 and 1 -> 1
 0 and 0 -> 0
so if multiple activatorscan bind to UR, they all need to be on to swith the gene on
if only one activatorcan bind to UR, it being on suffices to swith the gene on
however if zero activators can bind to UR, make sure that gene is off

inhibition:
max functie: (AND)  **no, I think the max function is also OR here, the prod function is AND**
 1 and 0 -> 0 and 1 -> 1
 0 and 1 -> 1 and 0 -> 1
 1 and 1 -> 0 and 0 -> 0
 0 and 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 1
so if multiple repressors can bind to UR, they all need to be on to switch the gene off
if only single repressor can bind to UR, it being on suffices to switch the gene off
however if zero repressors can bind to UR, make sure that gene can be on

inhibition:
prod functie: (OR)
 1 and 0 -> 0 and 1 -> 0
 0 and 1 -> 1 and 0 -> 0
 1 and 1 -> 0 and 0 -> 0
 0 and 0 -> 1 and 1 -> 1
so if multiple repressors can bind to UR, only one needs to be on to switch gene off
if only single repressor can bind to UR, it being on suffices to switch gene off
however if zero repressors can bind to UR, make sure that gene can be on


so both for activation and repression holds: as long as there is only one activating or repressing binding site the max and prod function are equivalent

for activation holds (independent of max or prod function) if there are no activator binding sites in UR gene should be off

for inhibition holds (independent of max or prod function) if there are no repressor binding sites in UR gene should still have **possibility** of being switched on

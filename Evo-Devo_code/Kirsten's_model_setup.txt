====== Kirsten's model setup ======
Created Monday 04 August 2014

**organism:**
- 100 cells
- genome with TFs and TFBS

**genome:**
- 16 gene types
- can have multiple genes of the same type
- gene 0: maternal morphogen, imposed wavefront
- 5: segmental gene
- 8-15: domain genes

**regulation:**
- genes impact each other with strength +1 or -1

**fitness:**
- segments and domain number
- min length of segment/domain: 7 cells
- compare expression at end with 20 steps before: is pattern stable? otherwise fitness penalty
- small fitness penalty for each gene and TFBS to prevent excessive growth

**evolution:**
- start with 50 individuals on 30x30 grid
- mutations: duplications/deletions, changes in type and weight of TFBS
- tournament selection for reproduction
- death prob is constant, 0.5

**analysis:**
- 50 simulations
- networks that evolved segmentation and domains: size and architecture
- developmental dynamics
- robustness of evolved networks: 50 new sims with added noise/higher mutation rate
- evolvability: evolve with specific target, then continue run with different target
- modularity: modularity score: Q value. Also pruned network for this

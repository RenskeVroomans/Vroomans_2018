====== void CellCellSignalling(int t) ======
Created Friday 17 January 2014

More complicated function.

if GRADIENT is defined, create a static Gaussian gradient depending on the timestep and position of the cell.
//Modification: this section now allows dynamic production and decay in the growth zone. No explicit diffusion, just a decay gradient.//

if WAVEFRONT is defined, displace the location of the wavefront every timestep (similar to what I did before)

**evolvable signalling**

update the array signalstates from the protein states of neighbouring cells

half of genes takes (sum of) input from direct neighbours, not from self --> notch-delta like
	* empty the the signalstates array for these genes
	* for every cell, check the states of the neighbours and add them to your position in signalstates[]

other half is diffusion-based cell signalling. has attached note that may require higher diffusion coefficient and smaller timesteps to get it to work.
	* empty the the signalstates array for these genes

====== void CloneAgentFromAgent(Agent  A int agid int t) ======
Created Friday 17 January 2014

**same as previous two, but now an agent is cloned and run again? Why? are there any mutations occuring  in the "cloneGenome" function? **

InitAgent(agid,A->agentid,t);
  G->CloneGenome(A->G);
  N->BuildNetwork(G);
  //wfspeed=1.+(uniform()*0.3-0.15);//if you want to add developmental noise
  DevelopAgent();
  DetermineFitness(t);
#ifdef RUN
  ancestry.push_back(-1);//beginning of ancestry, no parent
#endif

====== void WriteSignalProfiles(char dirname) ======
Created Wednesday 29 January 2014

Bit of a funny long function, writing data from the E 3d array to a file;

* selecting only certain time steps (k), looping through cells and protein types. → SignalProfiles
* selecting only certain cells (j), looping through time and protein types. → temporaldynamics


At the end, I added a loop to print data from cellpattern[][][], which contains cell-based data on the gene expression
(see also [[Evo-Devo code:Agent.hh:void StoreCellStates(int I);|StoreCellStates(int I);]] )

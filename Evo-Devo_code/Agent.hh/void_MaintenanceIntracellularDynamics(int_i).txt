You can choose: either you store the gene expression of cells at 1 point somewhere before the end of development (first half, !averagepattern)
or you average the gene expression per cell over a number of time steps (in maintproteinstates) and store the variance (varmaintproteinstates)

Both options allow you to check the stability of the pattern, but the second one is better at preventing oscillations of the pattern.

====== void CreateAgentFromParent(Agent  A int agid int t) ======
Created Friday 17 January 2014


**The difference between this function and the CloneAgent function is the mutation step**

  InitAgent(agid,A->agentid,t);
  G->CloneGenome(A->G);
  G->MutateGenome(t);
  N->BuildNetwork(G);
  //wfspeed=1.+(uniform()*0.3-0.15);//if you want to add developmental noise
  DevelopAgent();
  DetermineFitness(t);
#ifdef RUN
  ancestry=A->ancestry;//copy ancestry of parent as to be your ancestry
  ancestry.push_back(A->agentid);//add your parent to your ancestry
#endif

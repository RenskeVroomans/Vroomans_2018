====== void DetermineFitness(int t); ======
Created Tuesday 28 January 2014

Function that determines the value of fitness.

boundaries[]: probably stores for every boundary, the position of that boundary.

* first check in genome function [[Evo-Devo Code:Genome.hh:int CheckViability()|CheckViability()]] whether the fitness should be determined at all: are all gene types present?
* initialization of a whole bunch of things

loop through all cells but the last four: then you cannot check as far ahead with J.
	for every cell i, look up to 5 cells (j) ahead
		if cell i is high and cell j is low (or vice versa)
			* save the boundary position (j) if the switching is next to you.
			* else: look one pos away from cell i. if the switch is still true, , then move i one up, untill you are next to j or as close to j as makes a significant difference (boundary is fuzzy).
			* then save boundary pos (while keeping in mind that boundary can be fuzzy)

* then from nr of boundaries, determine nr of bands
* decide which bands are broad enough to count:
loop through all bands	
	store in **bands: begin, end, length, sufficient width?
	

* penalty for many 'last-minute' changes
* penalty for large nr of genes and large nr of TFBS
* penalty for having too short segments (total-adequate segments)
* nonexpfitness: max (0.001, nrlongbands-penalties)

fitness=exp(c*nonexpfitness)-1

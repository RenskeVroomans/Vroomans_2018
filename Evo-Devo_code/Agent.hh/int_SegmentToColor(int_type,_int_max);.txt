====== int SegmentToColor(int type, int max); ======
Created Tuesday 10 March 2015

To make space-time plots where only the concentration of the segmentation gene is depicted: returns a value between 0 and 255 depending on the concentration of the given gene.
I only use it in the analysis program I think.

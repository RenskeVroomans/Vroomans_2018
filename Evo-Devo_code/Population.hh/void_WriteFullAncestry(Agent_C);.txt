====== void WriteFullAncestry(Agent C); ======
Created Friday 31 January 2014

Only for a rerun apparently

* if you find agent C within popancestry:
	* write the agent's info to a file, but only stuff like id, birth time, bands etc, nothing about ancestry...
	* call function WriteGenome("") of agent C

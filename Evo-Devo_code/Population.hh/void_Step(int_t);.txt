====== void Step(int t); ======
Created Friday 31 January 2014

* Empty Ags2
* go through field 
	* if a spot is empty:
		* reset the cumfit 2d array (for neighbourhood?) to -1
		* Go through neighbourhood of empty spot:
			* add fitness of all agents to totalfit
			* add totalfit to the right spot in cumfit
			* count nr of agents
		* select an agent to reproduce (remember Sandro's method?) → go through cumfit 2d array. temp= uniform*totalfit.
		* if temp <cumfit[][], that agent will reproduce → break out of loop
		* call [[Population.hh:void ReproduceAgent(int t,int sourcei,int sourcej,int desti,int destj);|ReproduceAgent(t,memi,memj,i,j)]]

* select agents that will die with a certain probability.
	* call [[Population.hh:void DeathOfAgent(int i,int j);|DeathOfAgent(i,j)]] for those that die. The others are copied into Ags2
* Copy Ags2 back into Ags.
* Do margolus diffusion

**Note that, because you take the vantage point of empty spots, one agent can reproduce multiple times.**

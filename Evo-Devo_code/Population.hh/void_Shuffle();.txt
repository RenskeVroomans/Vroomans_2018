====== void Shuffle(); ======
Created Friday 31 January 2014

Randomly shuffles Ags field

* translates 2d field positions to single integer (placing row after row, 1,2,3...). These are pushed on the locations vector. I don't quite understand the why of this part though... you know how many positions the field has, you can simply put them in the vector, no need to go through field...

* Shuffle locations vector â†’ library function
* translate each integer in locations vec back to 2d position, and copy AG from this position to another in Ag2 (which is stepped through in normal order). 
* Copy Ags2 back to Ags

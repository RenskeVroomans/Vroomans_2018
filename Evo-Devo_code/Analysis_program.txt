====== Analysis program ======
Created Tuesday 26 August 2014

The analysis program is an amalgam of the simulation code and new analysis and printing functions. 
Kirsten's main program is more elaborate, also comparing agents and looking at domains. My version only analyses one agent.

It takes 4 arguments: agentID, the path of the FittestGeneration directory, the path of the directory where the output should go, and a boolean for whether to do the full analysis

**program flow:**

-Create a new agent, identical to the input agent
- Write its properties to a file:
	* WriteNetwork(0)
	* WriteBasicProperties()
	* GenomeAndNetworkProperties
	* Attractor properties
	* Loop and motif properties

- if Full analysis:
	* create several types of pruned agents, for which the genome, network and signal profiles are written to files.
	* create a file, GeneTFBSConnectionNumbers, which contains just the gene and tFBS numbers for the pruned agents created.
	* create a file, SegmentNumbers, which contains the number of long bands of the pruned agents

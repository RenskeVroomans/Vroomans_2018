====== void BuildNetwork(Genome G) ======
Created Thursday 23 October 2014

Function goes through genome twice:
first to pick out all the genes and put them in Vertex list VL.

second time it creates the list of lists of edges, AL:
goes through the genome backwards

every time it encounters a gene it pushes a new list at the front of AL: new node for which to store all incoming edges.

If it encounters a TFBS, we look up in VL which vertices match to the type of the tfbs
the first one gets the mark use=1; the others of the same type get use=0: in the running of the network, we use protein concentrations so don't need to consider the expression of all genes of the same type separately
However, different TFBS of same type do get into the list twice (-> no conflict with different strengths)
